#Problem statement -Manually generating report cards for students is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient—especially when handling multiple students. Teachers must repeatedly calculate totals, averages, percentages, and grades, which increases the chances of mistakes.
This project aims to automate the process of generating student report cards through a Python-based system that ensures accuracy, consistency, and speed.
#Scope of the project-Accepting student details such as name, roll number, and marks.
Validating marks to ensure they are within appropriate limits (0–100).
Calculating total marks, average, percentage, and grade.
Displaying the result in a structured report card format.
Storing or exporting generated report cards (optional based on implementation).
Handling multiple students, if required.
The project focuses on console-based report card generation and ensures modular, easy-to-understand implementation.
#Target users-
Teachers – who need a quick and reliable tool to prepare student report cards.
Educational institutions – small schools or coaching centers that want to generate report cards easily without software overhead.
Students & Learners – to understand their academic performance through a well-structured output.
Beginner programmers – as a learning example for Python project development.
#High level features-
Student Information Input:
Accepts student name, roll number, and subject marks.
Data Validation:
Ensures marks entered are integers and fall within the 0–100 range.
Automatic Calculation:
Computes total marks, average score, percentage, and grade.
Report Card Generation:
Produces a neatly formatted report card in the terminal or file.
Modular Code Design:
Uses multiple modules/functions for readability and reusability.

Error Handling:
Prevents crashes due to invalid inputs and prompts for correction.
